## Things I've learned:
    1. How to link to different pages
    2. How to add images to sites
    3. I'm lazy
    4. Seriously, I typed up one semi-complex recipe then just did Kraft mac n' cheese and a packet of ramen noodles
    5. How to properly format markdown since it looked terrible on the first push
