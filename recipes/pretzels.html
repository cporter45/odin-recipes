        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            These homemade pretzels are delicious and easy!
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 and 1/2 cup of <strong>warm water</strong></li>
                <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons <strong>instant</strong> or <strong>active dry yeast</strong></li>
                <li>1 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon <strong>brown sugar</strong> or <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon <strong>unsalted butter</strong> melted or slightly cool</li>
                <li>3 and 3/4 cups <strong>all-purpose flour</strong> plus more for the work surface</li>
                <li><strong>coarse salt</strong> or <strong>coarse sea salt</strong> for sprinkling</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Baking Soda Bath</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
                <li>9 cups <strong>water</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whisk the yeast into warm water. 
                    Allow to sit for 1 minute. 
                    Whisk in salt, brown sugar, and melted 
                    butter. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 
                    1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden 
                    spoon (or dough hook attached to stand 
                    mixer) until dough is thick. Add 3/4 
                    cup more flour until the dough is no 
                    longer sticky. If it is still sticky, 
                    add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more, as needed. 
                    Poke the dough with your finger; if it 
                    bounces back, it is ready to knead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the dough out onto a floured 
                    surface. Knead the dough for 3 minutes 
                    and shape into a ball. Cover lightly 
                    with a towel and allow to rest for 10 
                    minutes. (Meanwhile, I like to get the 
                    water + baking soda boiling as 
                    instructed in step 6.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line 2 
                    baking sheets with parchment paper or 
                    silicone baking mats. Silicone baking 
                    mats are highly recommended over 
                    parchment paper. If using parchment 
                    paper, lightly spray with nonstick 
                    spray or grease with butter. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, 
                    cut dough into 1/3 cup sections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll the dough into a 20-22 inch rope. 
                    Form a circle with the dough by bringing 
                    the two ends together at the top of the 
                    circle. Twist the ends together. Bring 
                    the twisted ends back down towards 
                    yourself and press them down to form a 
                    pretzel shape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water 
                    to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1-2 
                    pretzels into the boiling water for 
                    20-30 seconds. Any more than that and 
                    your pretzels will have a metallic 
                    taste. Using a slotted spatula, lift 
                    the pretzel out of the water and allow 
                    as much of the excess water to drip off. 
                    Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. 
                    Sprinkle each with coarse sea salt. 
                    Repeat with remaining pretzels. If 
                    desired, you can cover and refrigerate 
                    the boiled/unbaked pretzels for up to 
                    24 hours before baking in step 7.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden
                    brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and serve warm
                    with your choice of cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover and store leftover pretzels at
                    room temperature for up to 3 days.
                    They lose a little softness over time. 
                    To reheat, microwave for a few seconds 
                    or bake in a 350 degree oven for 
                    5 minutes.
